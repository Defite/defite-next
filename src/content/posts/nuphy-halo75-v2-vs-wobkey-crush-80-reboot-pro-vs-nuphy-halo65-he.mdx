Another old video, which I've made about 7 months ago and totally forget about it. 
For the past time I've bought quitem a bunch of keyboards, mostly from Nuphy company, because I liked the 
quality and how the looked on my desk.

It all ended with that magnetic keyboard stayed with my home gaming PC, green mint Nuphy is travelling with me to my work and
Crush...I've changed switches to Nuphy Mint and hated it. The sound is great, but typing is kinda soft.
I liked how mnagnetic Nuphy is responding to my touch and liked how ordinary Nuphy Mint switches works when lubed. 
And Crush stays in the box until I decide to sell it to real enthusiast, who will add more foam, lube switches and create
something special.
