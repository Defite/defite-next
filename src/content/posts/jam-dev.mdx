Occasionally found usefull instrument which can solve every developer's pain - somebody found the bug, but you don't know all details about how, where and why. [Jam.dev](https://jam.dev/) is a free [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jam/iohjgamcilhbgmhbnllfolmkmmekfmci) which can capture screenshot, record tab or whole desktop and share link to 'bug report'.

The report includes basic info about OS, screen dimension, browser, url, country where this url was opened etc. But the most exciting is ability to see user steps which led to the bug, network requests and ability to connect backend integrations such as Sentry. Also Jam has it's own AI bot, which can guess what is the problem and how it can help you with the solution. Fantastic!

Over all Jam has teams (on paid plan), beautiful dashboard and clean minimalistic interface.
